# react-test
Simple react application with following purposes:
- using next.js + react.js
- testing react apps with jest
- deploying react apps with different CI/CD platforms
- using typescript for building react apps

Thanks to Peter Kellner for his [course on pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-components-designing/) from which most of the code was created.
